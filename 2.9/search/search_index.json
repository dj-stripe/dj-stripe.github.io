They can also be terse, and nested objects can be done by reference to avoid duplication. But maintaining or upgrading them is a painstaking manual process.</p> <p>Generating the fixtures via Stripe gives the big advantage that Stripe schema changes are automatically represented in the fixtures, which should allow us to upgrade dj-stripe's schema to match Stripe much more easily. This would be done by updating dj-stripe's targeted API version (<code>DEFAULT_STRIPE_API_VERSION</code>), regenerating the fixtures, and updating the model to match the fixture changes. The down side is it's tricky to regenerate fixture files without introducing big changes (eg to object ids) - the script does this by mapping a dummy id to various objects.</p>"},{"location":"project/test_fixtures/#regenerating-the-test-fixtures","title":"Regenerating the test fixtures","text":"<p>To regenerate the test fixtures (e.g. to populate the fixtures with new API fields from Stripe), do the following:</p> <ol> <li> <p>(one time only) Create a new Stripe account called \"dj-stripe     scratch\", with country set to United States.

You are required to set it in 2.4.0: It does not have a default value. In 3.0.0, the default will be \"id\", and we recommend setting it to \"id\" for new installations. Older installations should set it to \"djstripe_id\". Explanation below.</p> <p>In dj-stripe 2.3 and before, foreign keys for Stripe models were set to point to the foreign model's djstripe_id field, a numeric integer generated by the local database. This new setting allows dj-stripe users to change it to use the \"id\" field, which is the upstream, non-numeric Stripe identifier.</p> <p>When using the Stripe identifier as a foreign key, synchronization between Stripe and dj-stripe can be made far more efficient and robust. Furthermore, it removes the per-installation instability of a critical value. The plan is to get rid of djstripe_id altogether for the 3.0 release (we may retain the field itself until 4.0, but it will no longer be a primary key).</p> <p>How to migrate older installations from \"djstripe_id\" to \"id\"?</p> <p>Such a migration path has not been designed at the moment. Currently if you want to switch an older installation to \"id\", the easiest way is to wipe the djstripe db and sync again from scratch.
